2. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
3. Verify all files saved correctly

### Issue: Styling looks wrong
**Solution:**
1. Clear browser cache
2. Check that `style.css` loaded correctly

- [ ] Can they identify 1-2 blindspots in themselves?
- [ ] Do balance tips feel actionable?
- [ ] Are real-world examples relatable?
- [ ] Page length feels right (not too long)?
- [ ] Print version looks good?
