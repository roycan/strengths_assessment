The original six “virtue categories” (Wisdom, Courage, Humanity, Justice, Temperance, Transcendence) that the VIA creators used are widely criticized as _conceptual rather than empirical_. Research shows that the 24 strengths don’t cluster neatly into those six groups, and many strengths overlap across categories. A more valid approach is to group them by _psychometric evidence_ (factor analyses) or by _functional domains_ (how they operate in life).

## 🔎 The Original VIA Groupings

-   **Wisdom & Knowledge:** Creativity, Curiosity, Judgment, Love of Learning, Perspective
    
-   **Courage:** Bravery, Perseverance, Honesty, Zest
    
-   **Humanity:** Love, Kindness, Social Intelligence
    
-   **Justice:** Teamwork, Fairness, Leadership
    
-   **Temperance:** Forgiveness, Humility, Prudence, Self‑Regulation
    
-   **Transcendence:** Appreciation of Beauty, Gratitude, Hope, Humor, Spirituality
    

### Criticisms

-   **Overlap:**
    
    -   _Love_ could fit under Humanity, but also Transcendence.
        
    -   _Perspective_ is in Wisdom, but also functions like Justice (guiding fairness).
        
    -   _Humor_ is in Transcendence, but often operates socially (Humanity).
        
-   **Empirical mismatch:** Factor analyses rarely recover six clean clusters. Studies often find 3–5 broader factors instead 
    
    -   **Cultural variation:** Some strengths load differently across cultures, suggesting the six virtues are not universal.
        
    
    ## 📊 Evidence‑Based Alternatives
    
    Research using large samples (e.g., McGrath, 2015; Stahlmann & Ruch, 2021) suggests **3–5 higher‑order factors** fit the data better:
    
-   **Intellectual/Strengths of the Mind**
    
    -   Creativity, Curiosity, Judgment, Love of Learning, Perspective
        
-   **Interpersonal/Strengths of the Heart**
    
    -   Love, Kindness, Social Intelligence, Humor, Leadership, Teamwork, Fairness
        
-   **Self‑Management/Temperance**
    
    -   Prudence, Self‑Regulation, Forgiveness, Humility, Perseverance, Honesty
        
-   **Emotional/Transcendent Strengths**
    
    -   Gratitude, Hope, Spirituality, Appreciation of Beauty, Zest, Bravery
        

Some studies collapse these further into **three “meta‑strengths”**:

-   **Caring** (Humanity, Justice, Gratitude, Love)
    
-   **Inquisitiveness** (Curiosity, Creativity, Love of Learning, Perspective)
    
-   **Self‑Control** (Prudence, Self‑Regulation, Perseverance, Forgiveness)
    

## 🟩 Suggested Alternative Groupings

Here’s a practical re‑grouping that balances research with classroom/leadership usability:

-   **Thinking Strengths (Cognitive/Analytical):** Creativity, Curiosity, Judgment, Love of Learning, Perspective
    
-   **Relating Strengths (Social/Interpersonal):** Love, Kindness, Social Intelligence, Humor, Leadership, Teamwork, Fairness
    
-   **Self‑Mastery Strengths (Intrapersonal/Regulatory):** Prudence, Self‑Regulation, Perseverance, Forgiveness, Humility, Honesty
    
-   **Meaning Strengths (Transcendent/Emotional):** Gratitude, Hope, Spirituality, Appreciation of Beauty, Zest, Bravery
    

This avoids forcing them into six “virtues,” reduces overlap, and aligns better with factor‑analytic evidence.

## ✨ Takeaway

-   The **six‑virtue model is more philosophical than scientific**.
    
-   **Empirical evidence supports fewer, broader clusters** (3–5).
    
-   A **functional grouping** (Thinking, Relating, Self‑Mastery, Meaning) may be more valid and more useful in applied settings like teaching, parenting, or leadership.
