# Domain Enhancement Plan
**Project:** VIA Strengths Assessment - Domain Insights Enhancement  
**Date:** October 31, 2025  
**Status:** Planning Phase

---

## Executive Summary

Enhance the VIA Strengths Report by adding actionable domain insights. Currently, domains (Analytical, Interpersonal, Intrapersonal, Emotional) are mentioned but not explained or made meaningful. This plan adds domain explanations, personalized archetypes, domain combinations, and improved micro-actions while maintaining the gentle coaching tone established in the blindspots enhancement.

**Scope:** Phase 1 + Archetypes + Domain Combinations  
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours  
**Target Audience:** High school students (ages 15-18) at science high school  
**Tone:** Gentle coaching ("you might notice..."), consistent with blindspots work

---

## 1. Project Overview

### Current State
- Domains used for color-coding badges only
- Simple count display: "Analytical 2 • Interpersonal 1 • Intrapersonal 1 • Emotional 1"
- Generic micro-actions per domain (2 each)
- No explanation of what domains mean or why they matter
- No personalized interpretation of domain patterns

### Desired State
- Clear domain explanations (what each means, how you contribute)
- Personalized archetype based on domain distribution
- Domain combination insights (synergies between domains)
- Top-strength-aware micro-actions
- Memorable, actionable insights students will remember and use

### Success Criteria
- 80%+ students understand what their domain distribution means
- 70%+ students remember their archetype
- Students can articulate "how they contribute" using domain language
- Tone feels consistent with blindspots (gentle, growth-oriented)
- Content fits on ~1 printed page

---

## 2. Content Specifications

### 2.1 Domain Explanations

**Location:** New section "Understanding Your Strengths Profile" after Snapshot  
**Format:** 4 brief paragraphs, 1-2 sentences each  
**Tone:** Informative, accessible, action-oriented

**Content Structure:**
```
Your 24 VIA strengths cluster into four domains that describe HOW you contribute:

• Analytical: You process information, solve problems, and build understanding. Core question: "How can we understand this better?"

• Interpersonal: You connect with others, build relationships, and create community. Core question: "How can we work together on this?"

• Intrapersonal: You manage yourself, regulate your behavior, and maintain integrity. Core question: "How can I show up at my best?"

• Emotional: You generate energy, meaning, and motivation for yourself and others. Core question: "Why does this matter? What makes it worthwhile?"
```

**Design Notes:**
- Use bullet points for scanability
- Include "core question" to make domains concrete
- Keep under 100 words total
- Maintain color-coding from existing badges

---

### 2.2 Domain Distribution Display

**Location:** Immediately after domain explanations  
**Format:** Text-based visualization + interpretation paragraph  
**Data Source:** Count of top 5 strengths per domain

**Content Structure:**

```
Your Domain Distribution (Top 5 Strengths):

Analytical:     [3 strengths] — Curiosity, Judgment, Love of Learning
Interpersonal:  [1 strength]  — Kindness
Intrapersonal:  [1 strength]  — Perseverance
Emotional:      [0 strengths] —

Pattern: Your strengths concentrate in the Analytical domain (60% of your top 5), with supporting strengths in Interpersonal and Intrapersonal. This pattern suggests a [ARCHETYPE] profile.
```

**Technical Notes:**
- List actual strength names for each domain
- Calculate percentages (e.g., 3/5 = 60%)
- Use em-dashes for visual alignment
- Set up structure to easily add CSS bar chart later

---

### 2.3 Archetype System

**Location:** After domain distribution  
**Format:** 2-3 paragraph personalized insight  
**Logic:** Pattern matching based on top 5 domain counts

#### Archetype Definitions (10-12 Presets)

| Pattern | Archetype Name | Description | Student Application |
|---------|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Analytical-Dominant** (4-5 of top 5) | **"The Deep Thinker"** | You naturally dig into complexity and build understanding through careful analysis. | Excel in research projects, independent study, problem-solving that requires depth. Partner with Connectors for group work. |
| **Interpersonal-Dominant** (4-5 of top 5) | **"The Connector"** | You build bridges between people and create spaces where everyone can contribute. | Excel in group facilitation, peer support, community building. Partner with Thinkers for research-heavy projects. |
| **Intrapersonal-Dominant** (4-5 of top 5) | **"The Self-Leader"** | You show up consistently, manage yourself well, and lead by reliable example. | Excel in long-term projects, maintaining habits, personal accountability. Share your systems with others. |
| **Emotional-Dominant** (4-5 of top 5) | **"The Energizer"** | You generate enthusiasm, find meaning, and help others see why their work matters. | Excel in motivation, morale-building, purpose-driven projects. Help teams through challenging phases. |
| **Analytical + Interpersonal** (3-4 combined) | **"The Thoughtful Collaborator"** | You bring well-researched ideas to group settings and enjoy helping others understand complex material. | Excel in study groups, peer teaching, projects needing solid thinking and smooth collaboration. |
| **Analytical + Intrapersonal** (3-4 combined) | **"The Strategic Achiever"** | You plan systematically and execute with discipline—turning careful thinking into consistent results. | Excel in structured projects, goal-setting, systematic skill-building. Create routines that compound over time. |
| **Analytical + Emotional** (3-4 combined) | **"The Purposeful Learner"** | You seek knowledge that matters and learn most when you see the bigger purpose behind the material. | Excel when you understand "why," meaning-driven research, connecting learning to values. |
| **Interpersonal + Intrapersonal** (3-4 combined) | **"The Steady Supporter"** | You build reliable relationships through consistent care and show up for people over the long haul. | Excel in sustained friendships, being the "steady one" in groups, long-term team projects. |
| **Interpersonal + Emotional** (3-4 combined) | **"The Inspiring Connector"** | You energize relationships and help groups see the meaningful side of working together. | Excel in team morale, creating positive culture, meaningful group experiences. |
| **Intrapersonal + Emotional** (3-4 combined) | **"The Grounded Optimist"** | You maintain discipline and hope—staying motivated through challenges while managing yourself well. | Excel in long-term goals, resilient self-management, maintaining optimism through setbacks. |
| **Balanced** (even split, no domain >2) | **"The Versatile Contributor"** | Your strengths span all domains, making you adaptable and able to contribute in multiple ways. | Excel in varied roles, adapting to team needs, bringing different strengths to different contexts. |
| **Three-Way Split** (2-2-1-0 or similar) | **"The [Domain A]-[Domain B] Bridge"** | You connect two strength areas, bringing [Domain A] and [Domain B] together in your approach. | Excel when you can leverage both domains—you're the bridge between different ways of contributing. |

#### Archetype Content Template

Each archetype includes:

1. **Archetype Name** - The memorable label
2. **Core Pattern** (2-3 sentences) - What this pattern means
3. **You Might Notice** (2-3 examples) - Observable behaviors
4. **This Serves You Well When** (2-3 contexts) - Where it shines
5. **Growth Edge** (1-2 sentences) - Domain(s) to develop or partner with

**Example: The Thoughtful Collaborator**

```
Your Thoughtful Collaborator Profile

Your strengths cluster in the Analytical and Interpersonal domains. You might notice that you naturally bring well-researched ideas to group settings, or that you enjoy helping classmates understand complex material. When you're preparing for a presentation, you probably research thoroughly and then think about how to make it clear and engaging for your audience.

This pattern serves you especially well in study groups, peer tutoring, and projects that need both solid thinking and smooth collaboration. You can bridge the gap between "getting it right" and "getting everyone on board." Your groupmates likely appreciate that you do your homework and explain things patiently.

Your growth edge might be in the Emotional domain—finding ways to articulate why the work matters, or in Intrapersonal—maintaining your own systems when you're focused on helping others. Consider partnering with Energizers to add inspiration to your analysis, or with Self-Leaders to build sustainable personal routines.
```

**Technical Implementation:**
- Create matching function that scores domain distribution
- Return archetype ID based on pattern
- Populate template with personalized details
- Include top 2 strengths in each dominant domain as examples

---

### 2.4 Domain Combinations

**Location:** After archetype insight  
**Format:** 2-3 powerful pairings relevant to user's profile  
**Selection Logic:** Show combinations present in user's top 5

**Domain Combination Library:**

| Combination | Title | Synergy Description | Student Example |
|-------------|-------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Analytical + Interpersonal** | "Thoughtful Collaboration" | Well-researched ideas meet smooth teamwork | "You prep thoroughly for group meetings and help everyone understand the plan" |
| **Analytical + Intrapersonal** | "Strategic Execution" | Careful planning meets disciplined follow-through | "You break big projects into clear steps and actually complete each one on schedule" |
| **Analytical + Emotional** | "Purposeful Inquiry" | Deep questions meet meaningful motivation | "You research topics you care about and your passion makes the learning stick" |
| **Interpersonal + Intrapersonal** | "Reliable Connection" | Consistent care meets dependable presence | "You're the friend who checks in regularly and actually follows through on plans" |
| **Interpersonal + Emotional** | "Inspiring Community" | Relationship-building meets energizing motivation | "You bring people together and help them feel excited about working as a team" |
| **Intrapersonal + Emotional** | "Disciplined Optimism" | Self-management meets hopeful motivation | "You maintain good habits even when it's hard because you keep the end goal in sight" |

**Content Template:**

```
Powerful Combinations in Your Profile

When your [Domain A] and [Domain B] strengths work together, you create [Combination Title]. 

[Synergy Description] For example, [Student Example].

This combination is especially valuable when [Context 1] or [Context 2]. Students with this pairing often find that [Observation about balance or effectiveness].
```

**Technical Implementation:**
- Identify which domains have 2+ strengths in top 5
- Generate 2-3 relevant combinations
- Include specific strength names from user's profile
- Show most prominent combinations first

---

### 2.5 Improved Micro-Actions

**Location:** Existing Action Plan section (replace generic actions)  
**Format:** 2-3 actions per domain, personalized to user's top strengths  
**Selection Logic:** Prioritize actions for dominant domains and top individual strengths

**Enhanced Micro-Action Library:**

#### Analytical Domain

*For Curiosity:*
- "Pick one topic from today's lesson that intrigued you. Spend 15 minutes following one question deeper using 2-3 quality sources. Jot what you discovered."
- "In your next class, write down 3 'why' or 'how' questions as they occur to you. After class, pick the most interesting one and explore it for 10 minutes."

*For Judgment:*
- "Before accepting a claim in your reading, pause to check: What's the evidence? What's one counter-argument? Spend 5 minutes evaluating."
- "When you make a decision this week, write a quick 'pre-mortem': list 3 ways it could fail and one mitigation for each."

*For Love of Learning:*
- "Choose one skill you want to develop. Schedule three 20-minute practice sessions this week and track your progress visibly."
- "After learning something new, explain it to someone (or write it out) within 24 hours. Teaching reveals what you truly understand."

*For Creativity:*
- "When you hit a problem, sketch 3 different solution approaches in 10 minutes—no filter. Then pick the most promising one to develop."
- "Take one routine assignment and add one creative twist: a different format, unexpected example, or novel connection."

*For Perspective:*
- "When facing a decision, ask: 'What will matter about this in six months?' Write one sentence to frame it."
- "In a group conflict, summarize both sides before offering your view. Zoom out before zooming in."

#### Interpersonal Domain

*For Love:*
- "Schedule 20 minutes of undistracted time with someone you care about this week. No phones, no multitasking—just presence."
- "Notice one detail about a friend's life (a worry, a hope, a small win) and follow up on it within 48 hours."

*For Kindness:*
- "Do one 'invisible kindness' this week: something helpful that no one will know came from you."
- "When someone seems to be struggling, offer specific help: 'I can [concrete action]' instead of 'Let me know if you need anything.'"

*For Social Intelligence:*
- "In your next group interaction, pause before responding when emotions run high. Take one breath, then reply."
- "Notice who's quiet in a group discussion and invite them in: 'Jordan, I'm curious what you think about this?'"

*For Leadership:*
- "When a group stalls, state the goal, propose one clear next step, and ask who can own it. Practice directive clarity."
- "After leading something this week, ask one person: 'What's one thing I could do better next time?'"

*For Teamwork:*
- "At the start of a group project, run a 10-minute 'roles and handshakes' check: Who owns what by when? Get explicit agreements."
- "Communicate progress proactively—update your team before they ask. Make collaboration easy."

*For Fairness:*
- "When making a group decision, write down the criteria you're using and share them before deciding. Make fairness visible."
- "Notice if one voice dominates discussions. Actively invite other perspectives: 'We've heard from X; let's hear from Y.'"

*For Humor:*
- "In a tense moment, offer one gentle, context-appropriate icebreaker that helps the group exhale—then return to focus."
- "Notice what makes your friends laugh (not just what makes you laugh) and use humor to include, never exclude."

#### Intrapersonal Domain

*For Prudence:*
- "Before saying yes to a new commitment, write down what you'll say no to in order to make room. Protect your capacity."
- "Add a 15-minute buffer to your estimate for any major task. Prudence includes realistic planning."

*For Self-Regulation:*
- "Design one 'focus block' this week: 45-90 minutes with clear start/stop rituals, phone in another room, one task only."
- "When you feel an unhelpful impulse, pause and name it: 'I'm feeling [emotion]. What do I actually want here?' Then choose."

*For Perseverance:*
- "Pick one habit you want to build. Do it daily for two weeks and track it visibly. Consistency beats intensity."
- "When a project gets boring, don't quit—make it finite: 'I'll work for 25 minutes, then reassess.' Usually you'll continue."

*For Forgiveness:*
- "If someone has hurt you, write it out privately: what happened, how it felt, what you need to move forward. Then decide if you'll share it."
- "Practice self-forgiveness: 'I made a mistake. I learned [X]. I'll do differently next time.' Then let it go."

*For Humility:*
- "Ask 'What am I missing?' in one important discussion this week and genuinely implement a suggestion."
- "When someone compliments your work, practice: 'Thank you, I worked hard on [specific aspect].' Own it without deflecting."

*For Honesty:*
- "Replace one vague statement with a precise, observable one: 'I'll finish by Thursday' instead of 'I'll try to get it done soon.'"
- "When you make a mistake, own it within 24 hours: 'I [action]. That caused [impact]. Here's how I'll make it right.'"

#### Emotional Domain

*For Gratitude:*
- "Write two specific thank-yous this week, naming what someone did and why it helped. Make gratitude concrete."
- "Keep a 'three good things' journal for one week: each night, jot what went well and why."

*For Hope:*
- "Frame one current project as 'from X to Y by when' and name the first visible step. Hope needs a plan."
- "When you feel discouraged, write one future outcome you're working toward and one thing you did today that moved you closer."

*For Spirituality:*
- "Start one day this week by writing: 'Today matters because...' Connect daily life to larger purpose."
- "Spend 10 minutes in silence, prayer, or reflection. Ground yourself in what ultimately guides you."

*For Appreciation of Beauty:*
- "Take one photo each day this week of something that moved you (nature, craft, excellence). Note why it matters."
- "Visit one place of beauty this week (park, gallery, overlook) and stay for 15 minutes without your phone."

*For Zest:*
- "Before a challenging task, do a 5-minute 'energy primer': movement, music, or a quick win. Enter with momentum."
- "When the group's energy sags, suggest a 2-minute reset: stand, stretch, share one optimistic observation."

*For Bravery:*
- "Identify one hard conversation you've been avoiding. Rehearse your opening line, then have it within 48 hours."
- "Try one thing that scares you this week (speak up, start a hard project, admit uncertainty). Practice courage in small reps."

**Technical Implementation:**
- Create action library with tags for each strength
- Select 2-3 actions per domain based on user's top strengths in that domain
- Prioritize domains where user has 2+ top-5 strengths
- Fall back to general domain actions if user has 0-1 strengths in a domain

## 3. Technical Implementation

### 3.1 File Structure

**Files to Modify:**
1. `/results/report.html` - Add new section after Snapshot
2. `/js/report.js` - Add archetype logic, domain combinations, improved micro-actions
3. `/style.css` - Add styling for new section (minimal, consistent with existing)

**No new files needed** - all enhancements integrate into existing report

### 3.2 Data Structures

**Archetype Matching Function:**
```javascript
function determineArchetype(domainCounts) {
  // domainCounts = {Analytical: 3, Interpersonal: 1, Intrapersonal: 1, Emotional: 0}
  
  const sorted = Object.entries(domainCounts)
    .sort((a, b) => b[1] - a[1]);
  
  const [top1Domain, top1Count] = sorted[0];
  const [top2Domain, top2Count] = sorted[1];
  
  // Single dominant domain (4-5 of top 5)
  if (top1Count >= 4) {
    return `${top1Domain}-Dominant`;
  }
  
  // Two-domain combination (3-4 combined, fairly balanced)
  if (top1Count >= 2 && top2Count >= 1 && (top1Count + top2Count) >= 4) {
    return `${top1Domain}-${top2Domain}`;
  }
  
  // Balanced (no domain has more than 2)
  if (top1Count <= 2) {
    return 'Balanced';
  }
  
  // Three-way split
  return 'ThreeWay';
}
```

**Archetype Content Object:**
```javascript
const ARCHETYPES = {
  'Analytical-Dominant': {
    name: 'The Deep Thinker',
    corePattern: '...',
    mightNotice: ['...', '...', '...'],
    servesWellWhen: ['...', '...'],
    growthEdge: '...'
  },
  // ... 11 more archetypes
};
```

**Domain Combinations Object:**
```javascript
const DOMAIN_COMBOS = {
  'Analytical-Interpersonal': {
    title: 'Thoughtful Collaboration',
    synergy: '...',
    example: '...',
    valuable: ['...', '...']
  },
  // ... 5 more combinations
};
```

**Micro-Actions Object:**
```javascript
const MICRO_ACTIONS_BY_STRENGTH = {
  'Curiosity': [
    'Pick one topic from today\'s lesson...',
    'In your next class, write down 3 questions...'
  ],
  // ... all 24 strengths
};
```

### 3.3 Rendering Logic

**New Section Structure:**
```html
<section id="report-profile">
  <h2 class="title is-4 section-title">Understanding Your Strengths Profile</h2>
  
  <div id="domain-explanations">
    <!-- 4-paragraph domain descriptions -->
  </div>
  
  <h3 class="title is-5 mt-4">Your Domain Distribution</h3>
  <div id="domain-distribution">
    <!-- Text visualization + strength names -->
  </div>
  
  <h3 class="title is-5 mt-4">Your [Archetype Name] Profile</h3>
  <div id="archetype-insight">
    <!-- Personalized archetype paragraphs -->
  </div>
  
  <h3 class="title is-5 mt-4">Powerful Combinations in Your Profile</h3>
  <div id="domain-combinations">
    <!-- 2-3 relevant domain combinations -->
  </div>
</section>
```

**Insertion Point:**
- After existing `<section id="report-snapshot">`
- Before existing `<section id="report-top5">`

### 3.4 Styling Specifications

---

## 6. Success Metrics

### Immediate (Post-Implementation)
- Technical: Zero JavaScript errors, renders correctly on all test profiles
- Content: Fits on ~1 printed page
- Integration: Flows naturally between Snapshot and Top Strengths sections

### Short-Term (2-4 Weeks - Pilot Testing)
- **Comprehension:** 80%+ students can explain what their domain distribution means
- **Memorability:** 70%+ students remember their archetype name
- **Usefulness:** 60%+ students find domain insights helpful for self-understanding
- **Tone:** 90%+ students find tone supportive (not labeling or limiting)

### Medium-Term (1-2 Months - Full Deployment)
- **Application:** 50%+ students use domain language when discussing strengths
- **Action:** 40%+ students try at least one strength-specific micro-action
- **Sharing:** Students voluntarily share archetype with friends/family (organic adoption signal)

### Qualitative Indicators
- Students can articulate "how they contribute" using domain concepts
- Students use archetypes in positive identity formation ("I'm a Thoughtful Collaborator")
- Teachers report students having richer conversations about strengths
- Students request depth on their archetype (shows engagement)

---

## 7. Risk Assessment & Mitigations

### Risk: Archetypes Feel Like "Personality Tests" (Limiting)
**Likelihood:** Medium  
**Impact:** High (contradicts growth mindset)  
**Mitigation:**
- Frame as "patterns in your current top strengths" not "who you are"
- Include growth edges that point to development
- Use "you might notice" language to allow variation
- Add disclaimer: "Strengths can shift as you develop—this is a snapshot"

### Risk: Students Don't Connect With Assigned Archetype
**Likelihood:** Low-Medium  
**Impact:** Medium  
**Mitigation:**
- Test archetype descriptions with students before deployment
- Allow for hybrid patterns ("Bridge" archetypes)
- Include multiple examples in "You Might Notice" so some will resonate
- Frame as insight tool, not identity label

### Risk: Content Feels Too Long/Overwhelming
**Likelihood:** Low  
**Impact:** Medium  
**Mitigation:**
- Keep total addition to ~1 page
- Use clear subheadings for scanability
- Break into digestible chunks (4 subsections)
- Make each part independently valuable

### Risk: Micro-Actions Feel Generic Despite Personalization
**Likelihood:** Low  
**Impact:** Low-Medium  
**Mitigation:**
- Include strength names in actions where relevant
- Provide 2-3 options per strength for variety
- Test actions with students for authenticity
- Iterate based on which actions students actually try

### Risk: Technical Complexity Delays Implementation
**Likelihood:** Low  
**Impact:** Low  
**Mitigation:**
- Keep logic simple (pattern matching, not ML)
- Use existing data structures where possible
- Build incrementally and test each piece
- Fallback to simpler logic if matching fails

---

## 8. Future Enhancements (Post-V1)

### Version 2 (Medium-Term)
- Add simple CSS bar chart for domain distribution
- Create "Download Your Archetype" one-pager (PDF)
- Add "Team Composition" tool (compare archetypes in groups)
- Expand micro-action library based on usage data

### Version 3 (Long-Term)
- Dynamic archetype generation for unusual patterns
- Context-specific interpretations (group projects, leadership, solo study)
- Track which micro-actions students try most
- Integration with learning styles report (cross-assessment insights)
- "Growth Journey" tracking: how domain distribution shifts over time

Understanding Your Strengths Profile

Your 24 VIA strengths cluster into four domains that describe HOW you contribute:

• Analytical: You process information, solve problems, and build understanding. 
  Core question: "How can we understand this better?"

• Interpersonal: You connect with others, build relationships, and create community. 
  Core question: "How can we work together on this?"

• Intrapersonal: You manage yourself, regulate your behavior, and maintain integrity. 
  Core question: "How can I show up at my best?"

• Emotional: You generate energy, meaning, and motivation for yourself and others. 
  Core question: "Why does this matter? What makes it worthwhile?"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Your Domain Distribution (Top 5 Strengths):

Analytical:     [3 strengths] — Curiosity, Judgment, Love of Learning
Interpersonal:  [1 strength]  — Kindness  
Intrapersonal:  [1 strength]  — Perseverance
Emotional:      [0 strengths] —

Pattern: Your strengths concentrate in the Analytical domain (60% of your top 5), 
with supporting strengths in Interpersonal and Intrapersonal. This pattern suggests 
a Thoughtful Collaborator profile.

Your Thoughtful Collaborator Profile

Your strengths cluster in the Analytical and Interpersonal domains. You might notice 
that you naturally bring well-researched ideas to group settings, or that you enjoy 
helping classmates understand complex material. When you're preparing for a 
presentation, you probably research thoroughly and then think about how to make it 
clear and engaging for your audience.

This pattern serves you especially well in study groups, peer tutoring, and projects 
that need both solid thinking and smooth collaboration. You can bridge the gap 
between "getting it right" and "getting everyone on board." Your groupmates likely 
appreciate that you do your homework and explain things patiently.

Your growth edge might be in the Emotional domain—finding ways to articulate why 
the work matters, or in building sustainable personal routines when you're focused 
on helping others. Consider partnering with Energizers to add inspiration to your 
analysis, or with Self-Leaders to build systems that keep you on track.

Powerful Combinations in Your Profile

Analytical + Interpersonal = Thoughtful Collaboration
When your research strengths meet your people skills, you create environments where 
good thinking and good teamwork reinforce each other. For example, you prep 
thoroughly for group meetings and help everyone understand the plan. This combination 
is especially valuable in study groups or when explaining complex topics to peers.

Analytical + Intrapersonal = Strategic Execution  
Your Curiosity, Judgment, and Love of Learning combine with your Perseverance to 
turn learning into action. For example, you don't just understand the material—you 
create study systems and actually follow through on them. This is powerful for 
long-term skill-building and consistent academic progress.

## Conclusion

This plan enhances the VIA Strengths Report by making domain insights actionable, memorable, and personally meaningful. By adding clear explanations, personalized archetypes, domain combinations, and strength-specific micro-actions, students will understand not just WHAT their strengths are, but HOW they contribute and WHERE to focus their development.

The implementation is technically straightforward, builds on proven patterns from the blindspots work, and maintains the gentle coaching tone that serves this student population well. With ~3-4 hours of development time, this enhancement delivers high value and sets the foundation for future assessment integrations.

**Ready for feasibility review and stakeholder approval.**
