## Notes

- All user stories are written from user perspective (not technical implementation)
- Stories can be checked off as they're completed during development
- Some stories may be combined during implementation (e.g., US-003 and US-004)
- Stories can be refined during pilot testing based on actual user feedback
- Priority can shift based on development constraints or user feedback

**Next Steps:**
1. Review and refine user stories with stakeholders
2. Map stories to technical tasks
3. Create acceptance criteria for each story (see UAT documents)
4. Begin implementation in priority order
