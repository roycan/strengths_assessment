Project: Strengths Resource Hub Implementation

Overall Goal: To create a three-part web experience that guides a user from understanding their assessment results to applying them in their daily life. The three core sections are the main results landing page, individual profile pages for each of the 24 strengths, and a series of application guides.

Part 1: The Main Hub Page

This is the first page a user lands on after completing the assessment. It serves as a central hub to guide their next steps.

    Suggested Route/Filename: /results/journey

    Objective: To welcome the user, explain the philosophy behind the strengths, and provide a clear roadmap for exploring and using their results.

Data Required: This page will need to receive the user's assessment results, specifically their top 5-10 "signature strengths".

Page Components & Content:

    Header Component:

        H1 Title: Congratulations on Discovering Your Unique Strengths Profile! 

Introductory Paragraph: "You now have a powerful insight into what makes you tick. This isn't just a list of labels; it's a guide to unlocking a more energized, authentic, and successful life. Let's get started." 

Static Content Component: "What are Strengths?"

    H2 Title: What Are Character Strengths? (A Quick Refresher) 

Body: A brief explanation that frames strengths as "your personal sources of energy" and "the real you in action." 

Static Content Component: "The Golden Rule"

    H2 Title: The Golden Rule: Awareness is Good, Action is Better 

Body: A short, motivational section explaining that real benefits come from using strengths, not just knowing them.

Roadmap Component:

    H2 Title: Your Roadmap to a Strengths-Based Life 

Section 1: Dynamic Strengths List

    H3 Title: Step 1: Deep Dive into Your Signature Strengths 

Instructions: "Your top 5-10 strengths are your 'signature strengths.' They are core to who you are. Click on each of your top strengths below to explore them in detail." 

Functionality: This section must dynamically generate a list of links based on the user's results. Each link should go to the corresponding individual strength profile page (e.g., /strengths/curiosity).

Section 2: 4-Step Method

    H3 Title: Step 2: Learn the 4-Step Method for Using Your Strengths 

Content: A list or set of cards explaining the framework:

    Spot: Become a detective of your own best moments.

Explore: Understand the nuances of your top strengths.

Apply: Intentionally use your strengths in new ways.

Reflect: Notice the positive impact it has.

Section 3: Application Guide Links

    H3 Title: Step 3: Put Your Strengths into Practice 

Instructions: "Ready to apply your strengths in the real world? Explore our guides on using your unique profile to excel in the areas that matter most to you." 

Links (Static):

    Link to "Using Your Strengths at Work" 

Link to "Building Stronger Relationships with Your Strengths" 

Link to "Overcoming Challenges with Your Strengths" 

Static Content Component: "Lesser Strengths"

    H2 Title: What About My "Lesser" Strengths? 

Body: An important section explaining that strengths at the bottom of the list are not "weaknesses" but are simply less natural or used.

Part 2: Individual Strength Profile Pages (x24)

These are the detailed resource pages for each of the 24 character strengths.

    Suggested Route/Filename: /strengths/[strengthSlug] (e.g., /strengths/curiosity)

    Objective: To provide a comprehensive, inspiring, and actionable guide for each specific strength.

    Data Structure: It would be highly efficient to store the content for all 24 strengths in a structured format like a JSON file or a database table. A single entry might look like this:

JSON

{
  "id": "curiosity",
  "displayName": "Curiosity",
  "thematicTitle": "The Explorer's Guide to: CURIOSITY",
  "tagline": "A hunger of the mind, a love for the unknown.",
  "definition": "Curiosity is the engine of exploration and interest. It's the force that compels you to ask 'why?', to investigate new ideas, and to prefer the open road over the familiar path.",
  "signs": [
    "You love to learn for the sake of learning.",
    "You have more books than you can read and more browser tabs than you can count.",
    "You're often the one asking questions no one else thought of."
  ],
  "actionPlan": {
    "work": "Ask a colleague from another department about their work. Pick one routine process you do every day and research a better way to do it.",
    "relationships": "Instead of offering advice, ask a friend deeper questions about their experience. Explore a new hobby or type of cuisine with your partner.",
    "personalGrowth": "Visit a museum, watch a documentary on a topic you know nothing about, or take a different route on your daily commute just to see what's there."
  },
  "goldenMean": {
    "underuse": "Can lead to boredom, stagnation, and a lack of growth.",
    "overuse": "Can lead to a lack of focus, being nosy, or starting many things without finishing them."
  },
  "quote": "A powerful quote about curiosity."
}
