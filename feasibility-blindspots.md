- ✅ Static site architecture = simple deployment

**1.2 Changes are Additive (Non-Breaking)**
- ✅ New fields added to existing objects (backward compatible)
- ✅ Display page can show new sections without breaking old content
- ✅ Gradual rollout possible (add blindspots first, pairs later)
- ✅ No database changes needed (all static JSON)

**1.3 No New Dependencies**
- ✅ No new libraries, frameworks, or APIs required
- ✅ Uses existing Bulma CSS framework
- ✅ No build process changes
- ✅ Works offline/on GitHub Pages

**1.4 Display Complexity is Low**
